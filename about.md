Hi, I'm Brent McConnell.  I am currently employed as a Cloud Solution
Architect with Microsoft where I help customers and partners migrate workloads to
Azure.

I am an open source advocate and have spent much of my career working for
companies with large open source codebases.  Previous to Microsoft I've worked
at ...

* CloudBees as a Solution Architect helping customers understand DevOps and use
  Jenkins for CI/CD.
* CollabNet in Professional Services where I worked with customers to setup
  Subversion SCM.
* Novell as a Marketing Manager working on the open source projects Kablink and
  iFolder, both of which I don't think are active anymore.  
* Hewlett Packard as a partner engineer helping partners utilize HP solutions
  on Linux to their fullest potential.
* Alcoa as a programmer analyst where I started this never ending adventure in
  technology.
